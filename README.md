# TransE a TensorFlow implementation

The request of the project was to produce an implementation for an
algorithm (TransE, described in the paper [Translating Embeddings
for Modeling Multi-relational Data](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/1cecc7a77928ca8133fa24680a88d2f9-Paper.pdf)) to learn embeddings of entities
and relationships within the Knowledge Base FB15K and test the
model on the Knowledge Base Completion task.

In the future I might consider reorganising the code, but at the moment I am not planning to make any updates.

<h3> Please refer to the file TransE.pdf for further information.
