# TransE a TensorFlow implementation

The request of the project was to produce an implementation for an
algorithm (TransE, described in the paper Translating Embeddings
for Modeling Multi-relational Data1) to learn embeddings of entities
and relationships within the Knowledge Base FB15K and test the
model on the Knowledge Base Completion task
